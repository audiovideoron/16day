    A. Event Start, Event End
2. Book labor
    Script asks, 
    event_date = "What date?"
    event_set = "What day are you setting?"
    event_name = "What is the event name?" (pick from list)
    position = "What position are you looking for?"
    total_weight = :
    * a1 = 1
    * v1 = 1
    * l1 = 1
    * shift_flexibility = 1
    * det_preference = 2
    * client_relations = 1
    * reschedules = -1
    * no_show = -2
    * engaged = -1
    if v1 
    prospect = v1.labor.config && highest weight available
    for prospects
        if contact not booked on event (read calendar)
            event_candidate[] = prospect (build a list)
            for event_candidate
                twilio Are you date start, end time?
